=========================

I know I'm not a programmer. I'm trying though. 
Sorry if my readability is not quite the PEP8 standard. I'm working on it.
Just learning the code is a start..... A great place to start IMHO.

In this application I was really trying to get a grip on using arrays and objects (the segment) to make a display. Please if you see this and can show me better implimentation/coding methods then I urge you to comment, modify and share. I want to know more.


Just a means to a cause to learn more about python

v2 allows re-sizeing
